This repository explores the basics of fetching internet resources using the urllib package and provides a quickstart guide for the requests package.

How to Fetch Internet Resources Using urllib Package
The urllib package in Python is a collection of modules that allow you to handle various internet protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and so on. It provides several functions for working with URLs, including opening and reading URLs, sending requests, and handling responses.

The following steps provide a basic guide on how to use urllib to fetch internet resources:

Import the urllib package:
arduino
Copy code
import urllib.request
Open the URL you want to access using the urlopen() function:
rust
Copy code
response = urllib.request.urlopen('https://www.example.com')
Read the contents of the response using the read() function:
css
Copy code
html = response.read()
Close the response object:
go
Copy code
response.close()
Process the contents of the response as required.
Quickstart with Requests package
The requests package is a popular Python library for making HTTP requests. It is a third-party library that simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests and handling responses. It provides a much simpler and user-friendly interface compared to the urllib package.

To get started with the requests package, you first need to install it using pip:

Copy code
pip install requests
Once you have installed the package, you can start using it by importing it:

arduino
Copy code
import requests
To make a simple GET request using requests, you can use the get() function:

csharp
Copy code
response = requests.get('https://www.example.com')
This will send a GET request to the specified URL and return a response object. You can then access the contents of the response using the text attribute:

arduino
Copy code
html = response.text
The requests package also provides many other functions for making different types of requests, including POST, PUT, DELETE, and so on. It also supports sending headers, authentication, and cookies, among other features.

Requests package
The requests package is a popular third-party Python library for making HTTP requests. It provides a user-friendly interface for sending HTTP requests and handling responses. Some of the features of the requests package include:

Support for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
Support for custom headers, authentication, and cookies
Handling of redirects and timeouts
Automatic decoding of content
Connection pooling and session management
To use the requests package, you first need to install it using pip:

Copy code
pip install requests
You can then import it and start using it to make HTTP requests:

java
Copy code
import requests

response = requests.get('https://www.example.com')
The response object returned by the get() function contains various information about the response, including the status code, headers, and content. You can access the content of the response using the text or content attributes:

arduino
Copy code
html = response.text
The requests package also provides several other functions for making different types of requests and customizing request parameters. You can refer to the requests documentation for more details on how to use the package.
