Python Input and Output Functions

This repository contains information on Python Input and Output (I/O) functions. I/O functions are used to read data from and write data to files, which are stored on a computer's disk.



I/O Functions

Python provides several functions for performing I/O operations on files. Here is a list of the most commonly used I/O functions, in order of importance or prevalence:



open: This function is used to open a file. It takes two arguments: the name of the file and the mode in which to open it ('r', 'w', 'a', 'r+', 'w+', 'a+').



close: This function is used to close a file after it has been opened. It is important to close a file after it has been opened to ensure that any changes made to the file are saved.



read: This function is used to read the contents of a file. It takes one argument: the number of bytes to be read from the file.



readline: This function is used to read a single line from a file.



readlines: This function is used to read all the lines from a file.



write: This function is used to write data to a file. It takes one argument: the data to be written to the file.



tell: This function is used to determine the current position of the file pointer.



seek: This function is used to move the file pointer to a specified position in the file.



fileno: This function is used to obtain the file descriptor associated with a file.



writable: This function is used to determine whether a file is writable.



I/O Modes

In Python, when opening a file, you can specify the mode in which you want to open it. The following table summarizes the different modes available:



Mode	Description

'r'	Read-only mode. The file is opened for reading, and an error will be raised if the file does not exist.

'w'	Write mode. The file is opened for writing, and if the file already exists, its contents will be overwritten. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.

'a'	Append mode. The file is opened for writing, and if the file already exists, new data will be appended to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.

'r+'	Read and write mode. The file is opened for both reading and writing, and an error will be raised if the file does not exist.

'w+'	Write and read mode. The file is opened for both writing and reading, and if the file already exists, its contents will be overwritten. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.

'a+'	Append and read mode. The file is opened for both writing and reading, and if the file already exists, new data will be appended to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.
