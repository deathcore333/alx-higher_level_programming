Python Classes and Objects Repository

This repository contains various programs that demonstrate the use of classes and objects in Python, including setters and getters, class instances, private, public, and protected attributes, and the use of special methods such as __init__, __doc__, __str__, and __repr__.



Key Components

Classes

A class in Python is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that represent the characteristics and behavior of objects of that type.



Objects

An object is an instance of a class. Each object has its own set of attributes and methods, which are defined in the class blueprint.



Setters and Getters

Setters and getters are methods that are used to set and retrieve the values of class attributes, respectively. Setters are used to enforce constraints on attribute values, while getters are used to provide a consistent way of accessing attribute values.



Class Instances

A class instance is a specific instance of a class, created from the class blueprint. Each class instance has its own set of attributes and methods, which are defined in the class blueprint.



Private, Public and Protected Attributes

Private attributes are attributes that can only be accessed within the class, not from outside the class. Public attributes are attributes that can be accessed from anywhere, and protected attributes are attributes that can only be accessed from within the class or from subclasses.



Special Methods

Special methods in Python are methods with special names, such as __init__, __doc__, __str__, and __repr__. These methods are called automatically at specific times and are used to perform specific tasks, such as initializing an object when it is created, generating documentation, and representing objects as strings.



Contents

The repository contains the following programs:



Class Definition and Instances: A simple program that demonstrates how to define a class and create instances of the class.



Setters and Getters: A program that showcases the use of setters and getters to set and retrieve the values of class attributes.



Private, Public and Protected Attributes: A program that demonstrates the use of private, public and protected attributes in a class.



Special Methods: A program that showcases the use of special methods such as __init__, __doc__, __str__, and __repr__.



Usage

To run the programs, clone the repository and navigate to the desired program. Run the program using the command python program_name.py.
