 not use the function print (with string format to display integers) more than 4 times

You have to define:

the value 10 to a variable a

the value 5 to a variable b

and use those two variables only, as arguments when calling functions (including print)

a and b must be defined in 2 different lines: a = 10 and another b = 5

Your program should call each of the imported functions. See example below for format

the word calculator_1 should be used only once in your file

You are not allowed to use * for importing or __import__

Your code should not be executed when imported
