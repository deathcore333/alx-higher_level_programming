Test Driven Development (TDD) in Python

This directory contains various tasks focused on Test Driven Development (TDD) in Python. TDD is a software development approach where each function or feature is tested before it is written. The purpose of TDD is to ensure that the code works as intended, is maintainable, and is free of bugs.



Types of Tests

In TDD, there are several types of tests that are used to verify the functionality of code. These include:



Unit Tests

Unit tests are tests that verify the behavior of individual units of code, such as functions or methods. They test the individual components in isolation to ensure that they work correctly.



Integration Tests

Integration tests are tests that verify the behavior of multiple units of code working together. They test how the components interact with each other to ensure that they work correctly together.



Functional Tests

Functional tests verify the behavior of a system as a whole. They test the overall functionality of the system to ensure that it meets the requirements.



Acceptance Tests

Acceptance tests are tests that verify whether a system meets the acceptance criteria set by the customer or end user. They test whether the system is ready for release and meets the customer's expectations.



Getting Started

To run the tests in this directory, you will need to have Python and the unittest library installed. Simply navigate to the directory containing the tests and run the following command in your terminal:



Copy code

python -m unittest discover

This will run all the tests in the directory and display the results.
