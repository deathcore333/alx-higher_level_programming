JavaScript Object Basics and Modern JavaScript
JavaScript Object Basics
JavaScript objects are collections of properties and methods. They can be created using object literal notation, as well as using constructors or object classes. In this section, you will learn how to create and manipulate objects in JavaScript.

Object-oriented JavaScript
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects to represent real-world entities and concepts. JavaScript supports OOP through object prototypes, which allow objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. In this section, you will learn the basics of OOP in JavaScript.

Class - ES6
ES6 introduced the class keyword, which makes it easier to define and create objects in JavaScript. Classes are templates for creating objects with shared properties and methods. In this section, you will learn how to use the class keyword to define and create objects in JavaScript.

Super - ES6
The super keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent class. It is often used in conjunction with the extends keyword to inherit properties and methods from a parent class. In this section, you will learn how to use the super keyword to access and call functions on a parent class.

Extends - ES6
The extends keyword is used to create a subclass that inherits properties and methods from a parent class. Subclasses can add their own properties and methods or override those of the parent class. In this section, you will learn how to use the extends keyword to create subclasses in JavaScript.

Object Prototypes
Object prototypes are objects that other objects inherit from. They define the properties and methods that an object has access to. In this section, you will learn how object prototypes work and how to modify them to create custom objects in JavaScript.

Inheritance in JavaScript
Inheritance in JavaScript is achieved through object prototypes. Objects can inherit properties and methods from their prototypes, and those prototypes can inherit from other prototypes. In this section, you will learn how inheritance works in JavaScript and how to use it to create custom objects.

Closures
A closure is a function that has access to variables in its outer scope, even after that outer scope has closed. Closures can be used to create private and shared variables in JavaScript. In this section, you will learn how closures work and how to use them to create private and shared variables.

This/Self
The this keyword refers to the current object in JavaScript. It is used to access properties and methods of the object. In some cases, the self keyword is used instead of this to avoid conflicts with other variables. In this section, you will learn how to use this/self to access object properties and methods in JavaScript.
