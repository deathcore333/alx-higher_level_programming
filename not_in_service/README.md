JAVASCRIPT Introduction

    Writing JavaScript Code

JavaScript code is written in text files with the .js extension. The code is typically divided into functions, which are blocks of code that perform a specific task. Functions are defined using the function keyword.

    Variables

Variables are used to store data in JavaScript. They are declared using the var keyword. The value of a variable can be changed at any time.

    Data Types

JavaScript supports a number of data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, objects, and arrays. The data type of a variable determines the type of data that can be stored in the variable.

    Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on data. Some common operators in JavaScript include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and assignment (=).

    Operator Precedence

Operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. For example, in the expression 1 + 2 * 3, the multiplication operator (*) is evaluated before the addition operator (+), so the expression evaluates to 7.

    Controlling Program Flow

JavaScript provides a number of statements for controlling the flow of a program. These statements include if statements, for loops, while loops, and switch statements.

    Functions

Functions are a powerful tool for organizing code and making it reusable. Functions can be defined using the function keyword.

    Objects and Arrays

Objects and arrays are two important data structures in JavaScript. Objects are used to store data in key-value pairs. Arrays are used to store data in a sequential order.

    Intrinsic Objects

Intrinsic objects are objects that are built into the JavaScript language. These objects include the window object, the document object, and the console object.

    Module patterns

Module patterns are a way of organizing JavaScript code into reusable modules. Module patterns make it easy to import and export code from different modules.

    var, let and const

The var, let, and const keywords are used to declare variables in JavaScript. The var keyword is the oldest and most basic way to declare variables. The let keyword was introduced in ES6 to provide better scoping for variables. The const keyword was introduced in ES6 to declare constants.

    Modern JS

Modern JavaScript is a term used to refer to the latest version of the JavaScript language. Modern JS includes features like modules, arrow functions, and classes.`
