MySQL and SQLAlchemy
This repository contains a collection of exercises aimed at helping developers learn MySQL and SQLAlchemy. The exercises are organized by topic and are designed to cover a wide range of concepts related to MySQL and SQLAlchemy.

Topics
Object-Relational Mappers
Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) are software frameworks that map data between objects in a programming language and relational databases. In this repository, you will find exercises that cover the basics of ORMs and how to use them with MySQL databases.

MySQLclient/MySQLdb Documentation
MySQLclient/MySQLdb are Python modules that allow developers to interact with MySQL databases. The exercises in this repository cover the basics of using these modules to connect to a MySQL database and perform common operations.


SQLAlchemy
This section of the repository covers more advanced topics related to SQLAlchemy, including how to use it with Flask, common stumbling blocks for newbies, and a Python SQLAlchemy cheatsheet.

Introduction to SQLAlchemy
This tutorial provides an introduction to SQLAlchemy, covering topics such as how to install it, how to create a database schema, and how to perform basic CRUD operations.

Flask SQLAlchemy
Flask SQLAlchemy is an extension of the Flask web framework that provides integration with SQLAlchemy. The exercises in this section cover how to use Flask SQLAlchemy to perform database operations in a Flask application.


Python SQLAlchemy Cheatsheet
This cheatsheet provides a quick reference guide to SQLAlchemy, covering topics such as how to create a database connection, how to define a database schema, and how to perform common database operations.
Creating a Connection
java
Copy code
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine('mysql+mysqlconnector://user:password@host/dbname')
Creating a Table
sql
from sqlalchemy import Table, Column, Integer, String, MetaData

metadata = MetaData()

users = Table('users', metadata,
    Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True),
    Column('name', String(255)),
    Column('email', String(255))
)

metadata.create_all(engine)
Inserting Data
scss
conn = engine.connect()

conn.execute(users.insert(), [    {'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'john.doe@example.com'},    {'name': 'Jane Smith', 'email': 'jane.smith@example.com'},    {'name': 'Bob Johnson', 'email': 'bob.johnson@example.com'}])
Updating Data
less
conn.execute(users.update().where(users.c.id == 1).values(name='John Smith'))
Querying Data
sql
result = conn.execute(users.select())
for row in result:
    print(row)
Filtering Data
sql
result = conn.execute(users.select().where(users.c.name == 'John Doe'))
for row in result:
    print(row)
Deleting Data
less
conn.execute(users.delete().where(users.c.id == 1))
This is just a basic cheatsheet for SQLAlchemy, and there are many more advanced features and concepts that you can explore.
